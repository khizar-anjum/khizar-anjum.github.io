Hi, I am Khizar and I am a PhD student at Rutgers. My interests lie in the intersection of areas of Robotics, Artificial Intelligence and Signal Processing. I currently work at [CPS Lab at Rutgers](http://eceweb1.rutgers.edu/~cps/) under the supervision of [Dr. Dario Pompili](http://eceweb1.rutgers.edu/~pompili/). I was awarded an **NMF Gold Medal** along my Bachelor's from [Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS)](https://www.lums.edu.pk) for my outstanding performance.  

I love everything open-source and like to contribute to it a lot. I like how we come together as developers and make amazing things. I like to work on different projects which challenge me in my free-time and like to enhance my skill-set. I have showcased some of them here too. Also, feel free to dig around my blog and do contact me if you have any ideas. Stay strong and stay energetic.
