I"r<p>I consider my teachers to be the people who influenced me the most throughout my life. They helped me grow and become a better version of myself and therefore I feel that by teaching others, I can help them do the same. Based on these interactions, my philosophy of teaching resonates with Socrates’ as I believe in making my students question and possibly re-invent the material they are learning.</p>

<p>I had a great time working with my colleague <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vahideh-vakil-89985787/">Vahideh Vakil</a> under the supervision of <a href="https://www.ece.rutgers.edu/~asarwate/">Dr. Anand Sarwate</a> as a teaching assistant. We were mostly teaching sophomore students, the theoretical underpinnings of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_time-invariant_system">Linear Time Invariant (LTI) Systems</a>. My impressions from the course were mostly students being amazed at how far-reaching the implications of these simple mathematical theorems were.  We covered basic Signals/Systems, Fourier Transforms, Laplace Transforms and Z-Transforms. For this, I was awarded <strong>TA Achievement Award of the Year at Rutgers, 2020</strong> for which I am thankful to the Dr. Anand, Vahideh and the students who valued my efforts.</p>

<p>This course dealt with advanced concepts about circuits in general and had us analysing quite complex circuits. For me, it was a course where everything that I had learned in Electrical Engineering so far came together i.e. frequency analysis and practical hardware. Fortunately enough, I got the chance to help teach it to the Class of 2020 under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=pd9S_mcAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Dr. Muhammad Tahir</a>. He is one of the best mentors I have ever had and I am thankful to all his guidance and efforts.</p>

<p>The person with whom I had the pleasure of teaching this course was <a href="https://lums.edu.pk/lums_employee/2771">Dr. Momin Uppal</a>. He was the one who introduced me to the wonders of linear signals and the beauty hidden in the seemingly complex mathematical world of frequency analysis. He is one of the best teachers I have ever had and I am thankful to all his guidance and efforts. We covered basic Signals/Systems, Fourier Transforms, Laplace Transforms and Z-Transforms. I will always be grateful to Dr. Uppal for influencing my thoughts in such profound ways as he did.</p>
