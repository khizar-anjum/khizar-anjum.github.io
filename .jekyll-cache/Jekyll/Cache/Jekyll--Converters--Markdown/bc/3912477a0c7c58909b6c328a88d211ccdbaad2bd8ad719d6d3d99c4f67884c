I"å<p>I consider my teachers to be the people who influenced me the most throughout my life. They helped me grow and become a better version of myself and therefore I feel that by teaching others, I can help them do the same. Based on these interactions, my philosophy of teaching resonates with Socratesâ€™ as I believe in making my students question and possibly re-invent the material they are learning.</p>

<p>I had a great time working with my colleague <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vahideh-vakil-89985787/">Vahideh Vakil</a> under the supervision of <a href="https://www.ece.rutgers.edu/~asarwate/">Dr. Anand Sarwate</a> as a teaching assistant. We were mostly teaching sophomore students, the theoretical underpinnings of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_time-invariant_system">Linear Time Invariant (LTI) Systems</a>. My impressions from the course were mostly students being amazed at how far-reaching the implications of these simple mathematical theorems were.  We covered basic Signals/Signals, Fourier Transforms, Laplace Transforms and Z-Transforms. For this, I was awarded <strong>TA Achievement Award of the Year at Rutgers, 2020</strong> for which I am thankful to the students and teachers who valued my efforts.</p>
